# Development Patterns for AI-Assisted Coding

A comprehensive collection of **57 production-ready development patterns** converted to work seamlessly with **GitHub Copilot** and originally designed for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).

## 🎉 Now Available for GitHub Copilot!

This repository has been **fully converted** to GitHub Copilot custom instructions format. All 57 patterns are now accessible through GitHub Copilot Chat without any special syntax or configuration.

### Quick Start with GitHub Copilot

1. **Clone this repository** to your workspace
2. **Open GitHub Copilot Chat** 
3. **Use the patterns** with natural language:
   ```
   @workspace Implement user authentication using the feature-development workflow
   @workspace Run security scan on this codebase
   @workspace Generate API scaffolding for user management
   ```

See `.github/copilot/` for all available patterns and `.github/CONVERSION_SUMMARY.md` for complete conversion details.

## Overview

This repository provides **57 production-ready development patterns** (15 workflows, 42 tools) for AI-assisted software development:

- **Workflows** (`.github/copilot/workflows/`): Multi-agent orchestration systems that coordinate complex, multi-step operations across different domains
- **Tools** (`.github/copilot/tools/`): Specialized single-purpose utilities for focused development tasks

## Installation

### For GitHub Copilot Users (Recommended)

Simply clone this repository to your workspace and GitHub Copilot will automatically discover the custom instructions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/T-450/commands.git
cd commands
```

That's it! GitHub Copilot will now have access to all 57 development patterns.

### For Claude Code Users (Original Format)

```bash
# Navigate to Claude configuration directory
cd ~/.claude

# Clone the commands repository
git clone https://github.com/wshobson/commands.git
```

Then use slash commands like `/workflows:feature-development` or `/tools:security-scan`.

> **Note**: For a more modern Claude Code approach, consider the [**Plugin Marketplace**](https://github.com/wshobson/agents) which provides similar functionality through a cleaner plugin architecture.

## Using Patterns with GitHub Copilot

### Accessing Workflows

**Example prompts:**
```
@workspace Implement OAuth2 authentication using the feature-development workflow
@workspace Apply the TDD cycle workflow to build a shopping cart
@workspace Use smart-fix workflow to debug this production error
@workspace Follow security-hardening workflow for this API
```

All workflow patterns are in `.github/copilot/workflows/` with detailed instructions.

### Using Tools

**Example prompts:**
```
@workspace Generate API scaffolding for user management
@workspace Run security scan on this codebase
@workspace Create comprehensive test harness for this module
@workspace Generate Kubernetes manifests for this service
```

All tool patterns are in `.github/copilot/tools/` with specific examples.

### Discovering Patterns

**List available patterns:**
```
@workspace What development patterns are available?
@workspace Show me security-related patterns
@workspace Find patterns for testing
```

GitHub Copilot will automatically reference the appropriate pattern files.

## Legacy: Using with Claude Code

For Claude Code users, commands are invoked using directory prefixes:

```bash
# Workflow invocation
/workflows:feature-development implement OAuth2 authentication

# Tool invocation
/tools:security-scan perform vulnerability assessment

# Multiple argument example
/tools:api-scaffold create user management endpoints with RBAC
```

### Alternative Setup (No Prefixes)

To invoke commands without directory prefixes, copy files to the root directory:

```bash
cp tools/*.md .
cp workflows/*.md .

# Then invoke directly
/api-scaffold create REST endpoints
/feature-development implement payment system
```

## Command Selection Guidelines

### Workflow vs Tool Decision Matrix

| Criteria | Use Workflows | Use Tools |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Problem Complexity** | Multi-domain, cross-cutting concerns | Single domain, focused scope |
| **Solution Clarity** | Exploratory, undefined approach | Clear implementation path |
| **Agent Coordination** | Multiple specialists required | Single expertise sufficient |
| **Implementation Scope** | End-to-end features | Specific components |
| **Control Level** | Automated orchestration preferred | Manual control required |

### Workflow Selection Examples

| Requirement | Recommended Workflow | Rationale |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| "Build complete authentication system" | `/workflows:feature-development` | Multi-tier implementation required |
| "Debug production performance issues" | `/workflows:smart-fix` | Unknown root cause, needs analysis |
| "Modernize legacy application" | `/workflows:legacy-modernize` | Complex refactoring across stack |
| "Implement ML-powered feature" | `/workflows:data-driven-feature` | Requires data science expertise |

### Tool Selection Examples

| Task | Recommended Tool | Output |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| "Generate Kubernetes configs" | `/tools:k8s-manifest` | YAML manifests with best practices |
| "Audit security vulnerabilities" | `/tools:security-scan` | Vulnerability report with fixes |
| "Create API documentation" | `/tools:doc-generate` | OpenAPI/Swagger specifications |
| "Optimize Docker images" | `/tools:docker-optimize` | Multi-stage Dockerfile |

## Execution Best Practices

### Context Optimization

1. **Technology Stack Specification**: Include framework versions, database systems, deployment targets
2. **Constraint Definition**: Specify performance requirements, security standards, compliance needs
3. **Integration Requirements**: Define external services, APIs, authentication methods
4. **Output Preferences**: Indicate coding standards, testing frameworks, documentation formats

### Command Chaining Strategies

1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with workflows for foundation, refine with tools
2. **Pipeline Construction**: Chain commands in logical sequence for complete solutions
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Use tool outputs as inputs for subsequent commands
4. **Parallel Execution**: Run independent tools simultaneously when possible

### Performance Considerations

- Workflows typically require 30-90 seconds for complete orchestration
- Tools execute in 5-30 seconds for focused operations
- Provide detailed requirements upfront to minimize iteration cycles
- Use saved context (`context-save`/`context-restore`) for multi-session projects

## Technical Architecture

### Command Structure

Each slash command is a markdown file with the following characteristics:

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Filename** | Determines command name | `api-scaffold.md` → `/tools:api-scaffold` |
| **Content** | Execution instructions | Agent prompts and orchestration logic |
| **Variables** | `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder | Captures and processes user input |
| **Directory** | Command category | `tools/` for utilities, `workflows/` for orchestration |

### File Organization

```
~/.claude/commands/
├── workflows/          # Multi-agent orchestration commands
│   ├── feature-development.md
│   ├── smart-fix.md
│   └── ...
├── tools/             # Single-purpose utility commands

```

## Development Guidelines

### Creating New Commands

#### Workflow Development

1. **File Creation**: Place in `workflows/` directory with descriptive naming
2. **Agent Orchestration**: Define delegation logic for multiple specialists
3. **Error Handling**: Include fallback strategies and error recovery
4. **Output Coordination**: Specify how agent outputs should be combined

#### Tool Development

1. **File Creation**: Place in `tools/` directory with single-purpose naming
2. **Implementation**: Provide complete, production-ready code generation
3. **Framework Detection**: Auto-detect and adapt to project stack
4. **Best Practices**: Include security, performance, and scalability considerations

### Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `feature-name.md`
- Be descriptive but concise: `security-scan` not `scan`
- Indicate action clearly: `deps-upgrade` not `dependencies`
- Maintain consistency with existing commands

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Diagnostic Steps

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Command not recognized | File missing or misnamed | Verify file exists in correct directory |
| Slow execution | Normal workflow behavior | Workflows coordinate multiple agents (30-90s typical) |
| Incomplete output | Insufficient context | Provide technology stack and requirements |
| Integration failures | Path or configuration issues | Check file paths and dependencies |

### Performance Optimization

1. **Context Caching**: Use `context-save` for multi-session projects
2. **Batch Operations**: Combine related tasks in single workflow
3. **Tool Selection**: Use tools for known problems, workflows for exploration
4. **Requirement Clarity**: Detailed specifications reduce iteration cycles
